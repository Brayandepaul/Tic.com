    <h1> <b>The Beginning</b> </h1>
      <p>
        Mbappe burst<sup><a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/kylian-mbappe-and-real-madrid-timeline-of-transfer-saga">Tic tac</a></sup> onto the scene for an excellent Monaco side that<br>
        contained the likes of Bernardo Silva, Thomas Lemar, Fabinho, <br>
        Joao Moutinho, and Radamel Falcao during the 2016/17 season. <br>
        The young Frenchman, then just 17, scored 15 Ligue 1 goals <br>
        and six in the Champions League as Monaco lifted the league <br>
        title and reached the semi-finals of Europe's premier club <br>
        competition.<br>

        However, Mbappe's immediate reaction to that decision is that he is ready to sit on the <br>
         bench and not play at PSG until his contract runs out next summer.
         Being France captain and with the Euros coming up next summer doesn't alter his thinking.<br>
         He is willing to dig his heels in and sacrifice a season and there is nothing PSG can do about it. 
         He is ready to call their bluff and see who blinks first.<br>
